# System Manifest
# Entry point for implementation. impl-builder reads this first.
#
# This file provides:
# 1. System overview and type
# 2. Hierarchy visualization
# 3. File locations (all paths relative to spec/)

    Brief description of what this system does.

# =============================================================================
# HIERARCHY
# Shows the structure visually. Each team folder is self-contained.
# Agent specs live in agents/ subdirectory within each team.
# =============================================================================

hierarchy:
  # SINGLE AGENT example:
  # root:
  #   type: agent
  #   file: my-agent.md
  #   config: agent-config.yaml

  # SINGLE TEAM example:
  # content-review-loop:
  #   type: team
  #   pattern: loop
  #   folder: content-review-loop/
  #   files:
  #     team: team.md
  #     config: agent-config.yaml
  #   agents:
  #     - creator:
  #         file: agents/creator.md
  #     - critic:
  #         file: agents/critic.md

  # NESTED TEAMS example:
  # research-pipeline:
  #   type: team
  #   pattern: pipeline
  #   folder: research-pipeline/
  #   files:
  #     team: team.md
  #     config: agent-config.yaml
  #   sub-teams:
  #     - content-refinement:
  #         type: team
  #         pattern: loop
  #         folder: research-pipeline/content-refinement/
  #         files:
  #           team: team.md
  #           config: agent-config.yaml
  #         agents:
  #           - creator:
  #               file: agents/creator.md
  #           - critic:
  #               file: agents/critic.md
  #     - parallel-research:
  #         type: team
  #         pattern: fan-in-fan-out
  #         folder: research-pipeline/parallel-research/
  #         files:
  #           team: team.md
  #           config: agent-config.yaml
  #         agents:
  #           - researcher-a:
  #               file: agents/researcher-a.md
  #           - researcher-b:
  #               file: agents/researcher-b.md
  #           - merger:
  #               file: agents/merger.md

# =============================================================================
# FILES
# Complete list of all spec files for easy traversal
# All paths relative to spec/
# =============================================================================

files:
  root:
    - manifest.yaml
    - progress.md

  # List all team folders and their contents
  teams:
    # - folder: content-review-loop/
    #   files:
    #     - team.md
    #     - agent-config.yaml
    #   agents:
    #     - agents/creator.md
    #     - agents/critic.md

    # For nested:
    # - folder: research-pipeline/
    #   files:
    #     - team.md
    #     - agent-config.yaml
    #   sub-teams:
    #     - folder: research-pipeline/content-refinement/
    #       files:
    #         - team.md
    #         - agent-config.yaml
    #       agents:
    #         - agents/creator.md
    #         - agents/critic.md

# =============================================================================
# IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
# Suggested order for impl-builder
# Sub-teams can be processed in parallel
# =============================================================================

implementation-order:
  # For nested teams, process depth-first (leaf teams first)
  # Sub-teams at the same level can be parallelized

  parallel-groups:
    # - group: 1
    #   teams:
    #     - content-refinement
    #     - parallel-research
    # - group: 2
    #   teams:
    #     - research-pipeline  # Root team after sub-teams complete
