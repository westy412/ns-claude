## Your Task

Compare deepagents vs langchain-deep-agents and recommend the best merged structure.

**WAIT** for the analyzer to complete task #1 before starting.

### Step 1: Read Both Structures

Read:
- `/Users/georgewestbrook/.claude/skills/deepagents/SKILL.md`
- `/Users/georgewestbrook/.claude/skills/langchain-deep-agents/SKILL.md`

List all files in both directories.

### Step 2: Topic-by-Topic Comparison

For each major topic (getting started, subagents, memory, backends, skills, sandboxes, middleware, HITL, planning, streaming, persistence, file organization), identify:
- Is it in deepagents only?
- Is it in langchain-deep-agents only?
- Is it in both? If so, which has better coverage?

### Step 3: Recommend Final Structure

Based on your comparison, recommend:
- Final reference file list (merge both sets)
- Which version's content to use for each topic
- Any topics that should be split or combined
- SKILL.md routing table structure

### Step 4: Report to Team Lead

Send a detailed message to team-lead with:
- Comparison table (topic, deepagents coverage, langchain-deep-agents coverage, recommendation)
- Final structure recommendation
- Rationale for each decision

### Step 5: Mark Task Complete

Use TaskUpdate to mark task #2 as completed.
