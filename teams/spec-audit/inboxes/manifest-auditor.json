File existence — Every file referenced in manifest.yaml actually exists on disk\n2. No orphans — Every spec file on disk is referenced in manifest.yaml\n3. Hierarchy accuracy — Does the hierarchy match the actual folder structure?\n4. Agent names match — Do names in manifest match names in spec frontmatter and agent-config.yaml?\n5. Execution plan — Does it reference the right modules?\n6. Sub-team completeness — Are all 8 sub-teams listed (research-loop template, 5 platforms, industry, analytics)?\n\nWrite the audit report to: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-georgewestbrook-Programming-novosapien-ns-content-workforce/e357efd9-ae2a-4adc-b63d-191d8fcd7140/scratchpad/manifest-audit.md`\n\nWhen done, mark Task #4 as completed via TaskUpdate.",
