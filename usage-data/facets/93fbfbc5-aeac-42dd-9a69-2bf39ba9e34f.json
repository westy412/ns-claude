  "friction_detail": "Claude initially scoped the work too narrowly (just template selector), user had to redirect multiple times to expand scope to structured output, agent restructuring, and proper spec format; also missed the skill reference for spec building pattern.",
  "primary_success": "good_explanations",
  "brief_summary": "User wanted to implement infographic structured output with agent architecture restructuring; Claude helped design the architecture, wrote a detailed spec with parallelizable phases, and created a handover message, though scope had to be iteratively expanded through user guidance.",
